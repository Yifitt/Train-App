# Train-App

**Workout App Using MediaPipe (Python)**

This project is a workout tracking application built using **MediaPipe** in Python. It leverages pose detection to track various exercises, count repetitions, and evaluate form in real-time.  

Although this was one of my first large-scale projects, it taught me a lot about **object-oriented programming**, modular code design, and how to structure an app for scalability. The experience gained here was also valuable for later work in **machine learning** and **deep learning** projects.
